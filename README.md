## Prerequisites

### 1. System Requirements
- You must be using **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management version 10.0.36 or later**.

### 2. Set Up a Dataverse Environment
The Inventory On-Hand mobile app relies on **Dataverse**. You must ensure your environment is properly configured.

#### Steps:
1. Sign in to the **Power Platform admin center**: [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Environments > New**.
3. Set up a new environment or choose an existing one.
4. Ensure **"Enable Dynamics 365 apps"** is enabled.
5. Ensure **Power Apps Component Framework (PCF)** is enabled.

## Licensing Requirements
Each user must have a **valid Microsoft Entra ID license** and the required **security roles**.

### Required Security Roles:
- **Finance and Operations Basic User** (for Supply Chain Management)

To review licensing details, please see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

# Build, install, and other development processes
## Prerequisites
### Microsoft Power Platform CLI
- Install [Microsoft Power Platform CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI).

## Generate a new Canvas App binary
- Run the script 
```powershell
.\scripts\MsAppPackTool\MsAppPackTool.ps1
```
- This generates **msdyn_inventorymobile_b5ede_DocumentUri.msapp** under **/Solution/Export/CanvasApps**, which is compiled based on the source code at /CanvasAppSource

---

## Generate a new solution
- Run the script 
```powershell
.\scripts\SolutionPackTool\SolutionPackTool.ps1
``` 
- This generates **msdyn_InventoryMobile_managed.zip** and **msdyn_InventoryMobile.zip** under **/bin**

## Installing the Mobile App in Dataverse

Follow these steps to install the **Dynamics 365 Inventory On-Hand Mobile Application** in Dataverse:

1. **Navigate to the PowerApps Portal**: [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com)
2. **Navigate to the Solutions tab on the left side**
3. Select **Import Solution**
4. Optional: You might need to sign the solution file first, if your organization demands solutions to be signed - [Sign Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/signtool-exe)
5. **Import either the managed or unmanaged zip file from /bin**

---

## Applying changes
- Open the Inventory On-Hand App in edit mode from the PowerApps portal
- Make the required changes there
- Download a copy of the app
- Unpack the downloaded **.msapp** into this repository by running the script
```powershell
.\scripts\MsAppUnpackTool\MsAppUnpackTool.ps1 <msapp_file_path>
```
- Your changes are now reflected in /CanvasAppSource
- You can now generate a new app binary, followed by a new solution, using the steps described above.

### Localization (translation)
All translations are found in the [`/Translations`](/Translations/) directory. The baseline is [`en-US`](/Translations/Labels.en-US.resx).

#### Uptaking label changes

Once a new label is added, they should be injected into the Canvas app. Follow these steps:

1. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\LocalizerTool\LocalizerTool.ps1 -CopyToClipboard
   ```
   * You will now have the translations in your clipboard.
2. Edit the Canvas app in Power Apps studio.
3. Modify `App -> OnStart` and replace everything between the lines:
   ```csharp
   //localizer:gen-start
   ...
   //localizer:gen-end
   ```
   > To select the existing generated code, put your cursor right before the `With({`, then while holding `Shift`, press `End` twice and finally `Ctrl+V` to paste in the newly generated translation data.
